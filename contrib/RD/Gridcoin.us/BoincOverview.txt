GridCoin is a new cryptocurrency that aims to provide real benefits to humanity by compensating the coin miners for participating in BOINC projects 
that may lead to advances in medicine, biology, mathematics, science, climatology, and astrophysics by concentrating a large percentage
of the computational power towards BOINC research - instead of generating unecessary heat and wasted power for the proof of work
algorithms required to keep the coin network running.

It is estimated that bitcoin is using approximately 23,312 megawatt hours per day (see electric consumption @ http://blockchain.info/stats (24 hour stats)) 
of electric for block solving algorithms.  

The aim of the gridcoin project is to shift the computational power primarily to Boinc projects while the mining operations become a second priority -
so as the network is scaled up, boinc utilization is scaled up in tandem.

The coin miners will be rewarded with a small token subsidy if they fail to mine boinc shares, but a much larger subsidy when mining with boinc.

This digital cryptocurrency allows instant peer to peer transactions, worldwide payments and very low processing fees.
The source code is open source and allows everyone to take part in the success of the currency.

About the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for network computing grid:

Boinc is an opensource volunteer oriented computing grid that combines the processing power of all of the distributed PC's to concentrate on important projects.
Its free, and harnesses the unused clock cycles from PC and Video cards to aid in the research for the project goal.

Some of the major projects that you can participate in:

* Cancer research to help find cures for cancer and schizophrenia
* Rosetta@Home: 3 dimensional protien modeling, HIV, Cancer, Alzheimers
* World community grid: Various projects including researching strains of rice for regions where hunger is a concern
http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/research/rice/overview.do
* Malaria control 
* Alzheimers and Mad cow research
* DNA Sequencing, Microorganism identification, Bird flu research, protien docking algorithms, molecular biology, evolution research
* Nanotechnology research to find new molecular materials
* Large scale protien structure prediction, understanding diseases and pathologies
* Quantum chemistry
* Discovery of new drugs
* Microgravity and microfluid research
* Search for Neutron stars
* Particle accelerator research
* Cryptographic research
* Search for extraterrestrials
* Creating better weather models, predicting the weather








Mining:

Step by step mining document will be released this week.
Compatible with cgminer.



Security:


GridCoin leverages the latest code that brought bitcoin and litecoin to where they are today.
Gridcoin uses the stronger scrypt alogrithm to prevent manipulation of the blockchain.


Fair Go Live:

GridCoin has the LiteCoin 'instamine' prevention code built in.
Gridcoin will go live with a clean database, at a preannounced date to make it fair to all who want to participate in mining the coin.





Algorithm: scrypt (like litecoin)
Re-target: 3.5 days (like litecoin) with 2.5 min block targets
Block reward: 5-150, 5 if you mine with a miner like cgminer without Boinc running on the machine, 6-150 if you mine with boinc running, you receive a calculated subsidy based on boinc utilization.
Total coins: 84 million (like litecoin)
