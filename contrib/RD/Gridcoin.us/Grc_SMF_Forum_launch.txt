[b]GRIDCOIN - GRC[/b] 

Gridcoin (The environmentally conscious coin).

GridCoin is a new peer-to-peer internet based cryptocurrency that aims to provide real benefits to humanity by compensating the coin miners for participating in BOINC projects that may lead to advances in medicine, biology, mathematics, science, climatology, and astrophysics by concentrating a large percentage of the computational power towards BOINC research - instead of generating unnecessary heat and wasted power for the proof of work algorithms required to keep the coin network running.
 
It is estimated that bitcoin is using approximately 23,312 megawatt hours per day (see electric consumption at blockchain.info/stats (24 hour stats)) of electric for block solving algorithms.
 
The aim of the gridcoin project is to shift the computational power primarily to Boinc projects while the mining operations become a second priority - so as the network is scaled up, boinc utilization is scaled up in tandem.
 
The coin miners will be rewarded with a small token subsidy if they fail to mine boinc shares, but a much larger subsidy when mining with boinc.
 
This digital cryptocurrency allows instant peer to peer transactions, worldwide payments and very low processing fees. The source code is open source and allows everyone to take part in the success of the currency.
 
Gridcoin is based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs from Bitcoin in that it can be efficiently mined with consumer-grade hardware, therefore is not as likely to be replaced by specialized ASIC mining chips in the future.
 
Gridcoin provides faster transaction confirmations (2.5 minutes on average) and uses memory intensive scrypt-based proof-of-work algorithms to verify transactions.

SPECIFICATIONS
Scrypt Algo
Re-target difficulty: 30 minutes
2.5 min block targets, for quick confirmations for merchants.
Block reward: VARIABLE:    5 to 150 subsidy.    5 is rewarded if you mine with a miner like cgminer without Boinc running on the machine, 6-150 if you mine with boinc running, you will receive a calculated subsidy based on boinc utilization.
Total coins: ~168 million (est.)

MINING SUPPORT:
Solo mining with Boinc is supported.
Pool mining will be released by the end of the year.
Mining document available on the web site.


Other Notes:

Gridcoin officially launched November 16th, 2013 @ 11PM.  
Miners were notified one week in advance that we would start over on a new port during go-live so that no one could pre-mine.
 

The code contains all of litecoin's security features.


What makes gridcoin different?  Gridcoin requires miners to mine with BOINC running (http://en.wikipedia....twork_Computing) and aims to benefit humanity by providing real value while mining instead of generating heat and wasting electricity.
 
There are a few technical considerations, to make this coin successful.
 
1) For security purposes, pool mining is not possible yet but is coming.
2) You must mine against the loopback address.  Gridcoin will let you mine against  a pool of addresses that are not loopback IPs, using a standard version of cgminer, with scrypt, with Litecoin settings, but you will only receive a 5 GRC subsidy instead of the variable subsidy.
3) When you mine with cgminer against the loopback address with boinc, the gridcoin server will award a higher calculated subsidy to the miner.
4) Video cards are supported, but boinc must be running to receive the higher subsidies.
5) To start with boinc, download boinc separately, add a few projects that you are passionate about and run that program separately.
6) Gridcoin will measure the processes individual thread utilization, memory footprint, authenticity and send that information back to same thread that rpcmining is running on.  It will not provide a higher subsidy unless all of the requirements are met, and the mining module is registered to the machines registry.  Boinc Points will be part of the base algorithm soon.
7) Gridcoin has its own unique keys and new genesis block, and testnet is ready.  
8) For maximum security, the Linux version will work the same as the windows version and is not quite ready.  
 
The coin miners will be rewarded with a small token subsidy if they fail to mine boinc shares, but a much larger subsidy when mining with boinc.
 
This digital cryptocurrency allows instant peer to peer transactions, worldwide payments and very low processing fees.
 
The source code is open source and allows everyone to take part in the success of the currency.

About the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for network computing grid:

Boinc is an opensource volunteer oriented computing grid that combines the processing power of all of the distributed PC's to concentrate on important projects.
 
Its free, and harnesses the unused clock cycles from PC and Video cards to aid in the research for the project goal.
