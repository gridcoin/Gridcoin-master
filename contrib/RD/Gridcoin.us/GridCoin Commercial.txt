GridCoin, Commercial:


Gridcoin is a new cryptocurrency aimed at providing real benefits to humanity by 
forming a peer to peer network of boinc projects 
	that may lead to advances in medicine, science and other fields.

A cryptocurrency allows instant peer to peer transactions, worldwide payments and very low processing fees.

Gridcoin teams up with the Berkeley open insfrastructure computing grid to utilize
	unused clock cycles to power boinc projects in parallel with the algorithms that keep the network running.

The coin miners are rewarded less if they do not participate in Boinc, and more if they do.

Boinc has over 70 projects that include cancer, hiv, protien, alzheimers, rice strains, hunger problems, malaria, mad cow,
dna, nanotechnology and more.

Bitcoin currently consumes 23000 megawatts of power per day which ends up in the environment as waste heat.

Why not use a coin that benefits humanity by putting that work to good use?

Its easy to get started. Download the client to start, its free.

If you would like to participate in boinc, or in distributed mining, please read the mining document.

Lets support Gridcoin, the future green currency!
