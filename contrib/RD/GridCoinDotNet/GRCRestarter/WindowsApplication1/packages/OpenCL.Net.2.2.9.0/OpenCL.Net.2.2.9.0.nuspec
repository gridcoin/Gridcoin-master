    <description>Provides types, classes and methods that provide .NET bindings to OpenCL</description>
    <summary>.NET bindings for OpenCL that are easy-to-use and true to the original API. There is no 
OOP abstraction, nor will there ever be. OpenCL.Net is meant to be small, fast (with as 
little explicit marshaling as possible) and .NET friendly at the same time.
